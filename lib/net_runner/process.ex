  @moduledoc """
  GenServer managing a single OS process lifecycle.

  Handles read/write on pipes, graceful shutdown, and exit status tracking.
  Uses NIF-backed async I/O with `enif_select` for backpressure.

  ## PTY mode

  Pass `pty: true` to get a pseudo-terminal. This is for **interactive and
  long-running programs** (shells, REPLs, curses apps). Key differences from
  pipe mode:

    * No independent stdin close — the PTY is a single bidirectional FD.
      Use `kill/2` to terminate the process.
    * The terminal echoes input back, so reads include what you wrote.
    * Fast-exiting commands may lose output if you don't read immediately —
      the PTY buffer is torn down when the slave side closes.
    * For simple commands, use pipe mode (the default).
